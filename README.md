# the_web_developer_bootCamp2022
This is a repository for all code I'm working on within The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 by Colt Steele on Udemy.com
This will include each section I'm currently working on, starting from my current progress, and not including previous work completed. 
Hope it can help, I will attempt to write comments as I code along, and if you are currently going through the course as well, I hope it can provide some insight, as well as aid in my own learning progress.
